An implementation of a Constrained Nonsmooth Trust Region (CNTR) method based on Christof, De los Reyes, Meyer [2020]
(publication to appear soon!) applied to the Transportation Identification Problem (TIP) in the context of optimal transportation.

Implemented in Matlab, optimization toolbox is required.

The method's main code can be found in cntr_method.m, TIP_test_script.m contains a (randomly generated) instance of the TIP in one dimension (i.e., mu1 and mu2 are vectors) to play around with.
